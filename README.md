# Firestore Rules Syntax Highlighter for Vim

This didn't exist, so I figured I should just go ahead and make it. To install
using Plug.vim add the following lines to your `.vimrc`:

```
" Format `firestore.rules` files
Plug 'nicholaschiang/firestore-rules-vim-syntax'
```

That's it! And good luck with those `firestore.rules`!
